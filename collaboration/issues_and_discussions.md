# 💬 GitHub Discussions

## Overview
**GitHub Discussions** is a feature that enables open conversations within a repository.  
It provides a structured space where community members can ask questions, share ideas, and exchange feedback without directly affecting the project’s code.  
Unlike other collaboration tools, Discussions focus entirely on communication and knowledge sharing.

## 🧩 Core Concepts

### Discussion
A **discussion** is a thread where participants can post messages and replies.  
Each discussion has:
- A **title**
- A **body** (formatted with Markdown)
- **Comments** and **replies**
- Optional **labels** or **categories**

Discussions remain open indefinitely, allowing long-term conversations to evolve over time.

### Categories
Categories help organize discussions into clear topics.  
Common examples:
- **General** – open conversation about anything related to the project.  
- **Q&A** – questions and answers.  
- **Ideas** – suggestions and proposals.  
- **Announcements** – official updates from maintainers.

Repository administrators can create, rename, and remove categories as needed.
